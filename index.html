                <p>It wasn't until the 1970s and 1980s that electronic games became popular, when arcade games, electronic game consoles and computer games were introduced to the general public.</p>

                <h1 class="timeline-title">Evolution of The 2D and The start of The 3D</h1>
                <p>This is considered, for many, the golden era of videogames. Extremaly popular consoles, like the Super Nintendo and the Playstation 1, were active. Popular game franchises received some historical games, like: Mario Bros. (with Super Mario World), Zelda (with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) and Final Fantasy (with Final Fantasy VII). This was also the start, and the end, of some brands in the console war, like Sega and Commodore.</p>

                <p>It was in this decade that the Xbox console emerged and the PlayStation began to be more recognized, which are nowadays giant companies and it was between this interval of years that video games stopped focusing on children only and began to invest more in games aimed at the older audience.</p>

                <p>The new generation of video games comes with the promise of more realistic images and much shorter game loading times. The new video games bet on a hardware architecture with exclusive processors and SSD storage, which will allow much more power and faster loading, especially for companies' exclusive games, which will make the most of the settings. On the software side, the key term of the new generation is "Ray tracing", a computer graphics algorithm that renders three-dimensional images in real time, with a very convincing simulation of light rays. As a result, it delivers much more realistic images in terms of lighting, shadows, textures and reflections.</p>
